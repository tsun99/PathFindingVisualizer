# Pathfinding SwiftUI Project


This SwiftUI macOS project showcases a pathfinding visualization tool with user interaction. The app allows users to set up start and end nodes, place walls, and visualize the Dijkstra's algorithm in action to find the shortest path between the start and end nodes.

## Features

- **Start and End Node Selection**: Users can select the start and end nodes by tapping on any cell in the grid. The start node is marked with a blue color, and the end node is marked with a red color.

- **Wall Selection**: Users can set up walls (obstacles) by tapping on any empty cell in the grid. Walls are represented by a brown color and are impassable, making the algorithm find alternative paths around them.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm Visualization**: The app utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node to the end node. As the algorithm progresses, the cells visited by the algorithm are displayed in green, and the final shortest path is highlighted in yellow.
